				<h1>Northeastern University</h1>
				<p>Currently a candidate for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Linguistics with a minor in Chinese, I enjoy studying in the College of Computer and Information Science as well as studying abroad. Participating in the Honors Program at Northeastern, I am now a candidate to graduate with Honors in the Honors College. I have achieved Dean's List all semesters at Northestern so far.</p>

				<br>

				<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Activities:</div>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">First semester I joined a leadership program called BLUEPRINT LEAD 360. Every week we met and participated in activities that demonstrated all the qualities a leader should have. That same semester, I also signed up for a self-defense mixed martial arts class where we learned the basics of MMA and jiu jitsu. NUCALLS was another club I joined. It is a free, student-led language learning club. First semester I participated in Japanese level 1, and second semester, Mandarin level 4 (highest level). During first semester, I also participated in the 3rd annual Northeastern Chinese Speech Contest. <br>During my second semester I helped found a club called the <a href="http://neuchanguagetable.github.io">Northeastern University Chinese Language Table</a>, where students who are learning or fluent in Chinese can come together and eat lunch while conversing in Chinese. Being the Social Media Officer has helped me in expanding and promoting the club.<br>Being involved as a volunteer for the Peer to Peer mentoring system for incoming Computer Science Freshman has allowed me to experience the joy in helping others. During the summer before their first semester, they can communicate with me through email and ask about my experience at Northeastern as a new student.</p>

  							<p style="text-align: justify;">On my Robotics team, I was in charge of pit organization during competitions. Each sub-unit of our team (such as electrical, mechanical, pneumatics, drive team) has specific tools/items that they need at competition. Before competition I would talk to them and make lists of items to bring. As safety manager, I was required to be in the pit to talk to safety judges. We have been runner-ups for the Industrial Safety Award in my senior year season, twice in my junior year season, and a season before when I was co-leader. As Infrastructure Manager, I also oversaw and ensured that tasks are accomplished in Safety, Pit organization, Game Field, and Competition Practice.</p>
